# OAR Logic — Objective · Action · Result

A tiny schema that makes every proposal testable and trackable.

## Schema (YAML)
```yaml
objective: One clear outcome the circle seeks
actions:
  - step: concrete step
    owner: wallet-or-name
    start: YYYY-MM-DD
    end: YYYY-MM-DD
resources:
  eth: 0
  hours: 6
  ccc: recognition
result:
  measure: how we know it landed
  evidence: links or files to prove it
  follow_up: next objective (optional)

Rules 
* One Objective per proposal
* Actions are observable & dated
*Results include evudence or a follow-up objective
