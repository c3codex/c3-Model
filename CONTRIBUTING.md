This repo documents the **c3 model**. Edits should:
- Preserve Codex tone (*clarity > flourish*).
- Keep examples aligned with CCC = access/recognition.
- Use OAR blocks for any new initiative examples.

## How to propose a change
1) Open an **Issue â†’ Proposal** (uses the template).
2) Include OAR and expected Result.
3) Council will review in GitHub Discussions, then Snapshot.

Thank you for tending the circuit.
