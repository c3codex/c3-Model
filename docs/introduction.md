# ✦ The c3 Model ✦  
### Connect · Contribute · Create

The **c3 Model** is the living framework through which the DAO breathes.  
It is not a program or product — it is a **pattern**.  
Every system within the DAO — governance, art, Oracle, and treasury — flows through the same triadic current:

> ✦ Connect → Contribute → Create ✦  
> *Each circuit is a breath in the body of the DAO.*

---

## ✦ Origin

Born from the Codexstone, the **c3 Model** was conceived as a universal field-logic for cooperative creation.  
Where traditional governance divides through hierarchy, c3 unifies through resonance.  
It replaces extraction with circulation, transaction with recognition, and control with coherence.

The c3 Model is how myth becomes structure — how the DAO stays human while operating on-chain.

## ✦ The Three Circuits

### 1. **Connect**
The entry breath.  
The act of alignment — heart, intention, and resonance.  
Participants connect through:
- Oracle Cards *(artifacts of initiation)*  
- Rituals, surveys, and field calls  
- Shared language and mythic alignment

> Connection is recognition — *I c3 what you c3.*

---

### 2. **Contribute**
The current breath.  
The act of participation and offering.  
Contributions may take form as:
- ETH, CCC, or other resources  
- Art, writing, land, time, skill, or care  
- Teaching, stewardship, or creative labor  

CCC tokens are issued not as currency, but as **recognition of contribution** — inscription into the flow.

> Contribution is remembrance — *Every gift becomes Current.*

---

### 3. **Create**
The return breath.  
The act of manifestation — what the DAO brings forth through coherence.  
Creation includes:
- Artworks, festivals, publications, and governance structures  
- Rituals, educational initiatives, or community gardens  
- Any act that embodies the Codex’s living myth  

> Creation is restoration — *From many offerings, one bloom.*

---

## ✦ Governance as Circuit

DAO governance follows the same triadic flow:
- **Connect:** Council formation through Oracle and resonance.  
- **Contribute:** Proposals, votes, and CCC recognition.  
- **Create:** Enactments that materialize as projects, grants, or documents.

Every proposal follows the **OAR pattern** (Objective · Action · Result), ensuring continuity between vision and execution.  
Each motion is not just voted upon — it is **ritually recorded** and **programmatically enacted**.

---

## ✦ Oracle as Circuit

The **Oracle Cards of the Knew** embody the c3 flow in art form.  
Each card carries:
- A **Connect** glyph (attunement to the DAO)  
- A **Contribute** principle (breath or ritual practice)  
- A **Create** expression (action, art, or reflection)  

Thus, the Oracle becomes a mirror of the DAO — an embodied governance tool as much as an artistic artifact.

---

## ✦ Treasury as Circuit

The DAO’s resources move according to the same logic:
1. **Connect** — resources are acknowledged and dedicated through ritual intent.  
2. **Contribute** — ETH, CCC, or property flow into the Treasury.  
3. **Create** — distributions return to contributors, projects, and the commons.

This ensures that the DAO’s economy is not extractive, but **circulatory** — mirroring the regenerative field of nature itself.

---

## ✦ Codexstone Alignment

The **Codexstone** is the constitutional body of the DAO —  
but the **c3 Model** is its nervous system.

Where the Codexstone defines law,  
the c3 Model defines **motion** — the way law moves through life.

> ✦ The Codexstone seats the law.  
> ✦ The c3 Model keeps it breathing.  
> ✦ The Oracle mirrors it back to the field.

---

## ✦ Closing Seal

> The DAO is not a structure; it is a rhythm.  
> Every contract, card, and council breathes through the c3 Model.  
> This is our pattern, our code, our way of moving forward — together.

✦ *Connect · Contribute · Create — the circuitry of the Knew.*
