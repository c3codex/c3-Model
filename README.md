# ✦ c3 Model ✦
### A Living Framework for Decentralized Creative Communities

The **c3 Model** (Connect → Contribute → Create) is the foundational operating structure of the **c3 Community Partners DAO**.  
It translates community energy into measurable flows of recognition, resource, and renewal.

## ✦ Core Circuit

1. **Connect** — Entry and Alignment  
   Participants enter through art, ritual, or education.  
   The field forms through shared values and presence.

2. **Contribute** — Circulation of Resource  
   Energy (labor, land, art, or ETH) flows into the DAO.  
   CCC tokens recognize contribution and sustain continuity.

3. **Create** — Bloom of Action  
   Funded initiatives emerge — from gardens to galleries to governance upgrades.  
   Each initiative returns energy to the Connect layer, completing the circuit.

## ✦ The Current

CCC (the c3 Current) is not currency but remembrance.  
It records participation and grants access to DAO pathways, tools, and decisions.

---

## ✦ Scaling

The c3 Model can be deployed by any partner DAO or nonprofit seeking a regenerative structure.  
Future iterations will include:
- API and UI interfaces for integration  
- open-source templates for community governance  
- partnership onboarding protocols

✦ _The c3 Model is the Codex in motion._  
✦ _Each circuit restores the commons through participation._
